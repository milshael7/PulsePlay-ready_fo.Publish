# Routes Folder

This folder contains all route-related files for the frontend:

- `AppRouter.js` — Main router that defines the app's route structure.
- `Main.js` — (Optional) Entry or helper file for route logic.
- `README.md` — This file (you’re reading it!).

Purpose:  
To organize all frontend route logic and layout references in one place.
